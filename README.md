# Bookify Obsidian Plugin
Bookify is a plugin that allows users to add various paper-like backgrounds to their editor, ranging from bullet, grid and lined paper. 

I originally drew inspiration from Primary theme’s grid setting, and I wanted to expand that functionality to other themes via a plugin :)

## Features
- Paper-specific customisation:
	- Lined: Custom line height
	- Grid: Custom grid size 
	- Bullet Journal: Custom dot size and spacing
- Universal colour picker: Change the colour of the lines/grids/dots
- Universal transparency: Change the transparency to accomodate different colour visibilities

## Installation
##### From Obsidian Community Plugins
1. Open ‘Settings’ in Obsidian
2. Navigate to ‘Community plugins’ and turn off ‘Restricted Mode’
3. Click ‘Browse’ and search ‘Bookify’
4. Install the plugin and enable it

##### Manual Installation
1. Download the latest release from the GitHub releases page
2. Extract the files into the `obsidian/plugins/` folder
3. Reload Obsidian and enable the plugins in ‘Settings’ > ‘Community Plugins’
